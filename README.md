# DocVision OCR

**DocVision OCR** is a powerful Streamlit-based web application that leverages the [Mistral OCR API](https://docs.mistralai.com/) to extract text from both PDF documents and images. Users can either provide a URL or upload a local file. The app displays the original document (or image) in a preview alongside the extracted OCR results with multiple download options.
